# Function definition :
A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called.
You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function.
functions are used to perform certain actions, and they are important for reusing code, Define the code once, and use it many times,

## Predefined Functions : 
so it turns out you already know what a function is, You have been using it  the whole time while studying this tutorial!
## C Function Parameters : 
Information can be passed to functions as a parameter, paramerters act as variables inside the function.
Parameters are specified after the function name, inside the parentheses, you can add as many parameters as you want, just seperate them with a comma: 

## Function Declaration and definition:

    - declaration : the function's name, return type, and parameters(if any).
    - Definition : the body of the function (code to be executed)

## C recurion
recursion is the technique of making a function call itself, this technique provides a way to break complicated problems downs into simple problems which are easier to solve;
